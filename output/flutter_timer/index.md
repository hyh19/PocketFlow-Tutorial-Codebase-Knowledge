# Tutorial: flutter_timer

This project is a simple **timer** application built with Flutter.
It **counts down** from a set time, allowing you to **start**, **pause**, **resume**, and **reset** it using on-screen buttons.
The timer's state and actions are managed by a central "brain" that uses a "clock" to keep track of the passing seconds and updates the display.
