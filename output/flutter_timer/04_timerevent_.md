# Chapter 4: TimerEvent

Welcome back, future Flutter developer! In the last few chapters, we looked at what our timer app looks like ([Chapter 1: TimerPage/TimerView](01_timerpage_timerview_.md)), the buttons you press ([Chapter 2: Actions (Widget)](02_actions__widget_.md)), and where the time is shown ([Chapter 3: TimerText (Widget)](03_timertext__widget_.md)).

But how do the buttons (`Actions`) actually *tell* the timer to do something, like start counting, pause, or reset? They can't directly change the timer's internal working because that logic lives in the "brain," the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md).

This is where `TimerEvent` comes in!

### What is a TimerEvent? Sending Commands to the Brain

Think of the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md) as a military commander who needs instructions. You, the user, are giving these instructions by tapping buttons on the screen. A `TimerEvent` is like sending a specific **command** to the commander ([TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md)).

When you tap the "Start" button, the `Actions` widget doesn't just say "Start!". It sends a structured message, a `TimerStarted` event, to the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md). When you tap "Pause", it sends a `TimerPaused` event, and so on.

The [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md) is constantly listening for these `TimerEvent` commands. When it receives one, it processes the command and updates the timer's state (like changing from "paused" to "running").

### The Different Commands (TimerEvents)

In our timer app, we have a few main commands you can send. Each command is represented by a different type of `TimerEvent`:

*   `TimerStarted`: "Commander! Start counting down the timer!" This event usually includes how long the timer should start with.
*   `TimerPaused`: "Commander! Stop counting for now, but remember the current time!"
*   `TimerResumed`: "Commander! Okay, you can continue counting down from where you left off!"
*   `TimerReset`: "Commander! Forget everything and set the timer back to its initial time!"
*   `_TimerTicked`: This is a special *internal* event. It's like the second hand on a clock ticking. The brain ([TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md)) sends this event to *itself* every second to remind itself to decrease the duration. You, the user, don't send this one!

These events are defined in a file called `timer_event.dart`.

```dart
// Inside lib/timer/bloc/timer_event.dart

part of 'timer_bloc.dart'; // This connects it to the TimerBloc file

sealed class TimerEvent {
  const TimerEvent(); // All timer events share this base
}

final class TimerStarted extends TimerEvent {
  const TimerStarted({required this.duration}); // Tells the bloc the starting duration
  final int duration;
}

final class TimerPaused extends TimerEvent {
  const TimerPaused(); // No extra info needed
}

final class TimerResumed extends TimerEvent {
  const TimerResumed(); // No extra info needed
}

class TimerReset extends TimerEvent {
  const TimerReset(); // No extra info needed
}

class _TimerTicked extends TimerEvent { // Notice the underscore - it's private!
  const _TimerTicked({required this.duration}); // Tells the bloc the new duration
  final int duration;
}
```

Let's look at this simple code:

*   `sealed class TimerEvent`: This is the base for all our commands. Think of it as the category "Timer Commands". `sealed` means all the *specific* commands must be defined in the same file.
*   `final class ... extends TimerEvent`: Each specific command (`TimerStarted`, `TimerPaused`, etc.) is defined as a `class` that "extends" `TimerEvent`. This means they *are* a type of `TimerEvent`.
*   `TimerStarted` needs a `duration` because when you start a timer, you need to know how long it should run.
*   `_TimerTicked` also needs a `duration` because it reports the new time every second. The underscore `_` at the beginning means this event is only used *inside* the `timer_bloc.dart` file and is not sent from the UI.

### Sending Events from Actions (Widget)

Now let's see how the `Actions` widget uses these events. Remember from [Chapter 2: Actions (Widget)](02_actions__widget_.md) that when you tap a button, the `onPressed` function runs:

```dart
// Simplified snippet from Actions widget
// ...
onPressed: () {
  // This line gets the TimerBloc instance
  context.read<TimerBloc>()
      // This line ADDS the event to the bloc!
      .add(const TimerPaused()); // Or TimerStarted, TimerResumed, TimerReset
},
// ...
```

This is the crucial connection! `context.read<TimerBloc>()` finds the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md) that was provided higher up in the widget tree ([Chapter 1: TimerPage/TimerView](01_timerpage_timerview_.md)). Then, `.add(...)` sends the specific `TimerEvent` command to that [TimerBloc](05_bloc_.md).

It's like pointing at the commander and saying, "Commander! Execute the 'Pause Timer' command!"

### How the TimerBloc Responds to Events

The [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md) has special instructions for what to do when it receives each type of `TimerEvent`.

```dart
// Inside lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart constructor
TimerBloc(...) : ... {
  on<TimerStarted>(_onStarted); // When TimerStarted arrives, call _onStarted method
  on<TimerPaused>(_onPaused);   // When TimerPaused arrives, call _onPaused method
  on<TimerResumed>(_onResumed); // When TimerResumed arrives, call _onResumed method
  on<TimerReset>(_onReset);     // When TimerReset arrives, call _onReset method
  on<_TimerTicked>(_onTicked);   // When _TimerTicked arrives, call _onTicked method
}
```

The `on<EventType>(methodName)` lines tell the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md): "Whenever you receive a `EventType` event, run the code inside the `methodName` function." These methods (`_onStarted`, `_onPaused`, etc.) are where the actual timer logic happens (we'll explore this more in [Chapter 5: TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md)).

When a `TimerEvent` is received, the corresponding method is called. Inside that method, the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md) will perform the necessary actions (like starting a tick timer, pausing it) and crucially, **emit** a new [TimerState](06_timerstate_.md) to describe the timer's *new* condition.

### The Flow: User -> Event -> Bloc -> State -> UI

Here's a simplified picture of how a user action (like tapping "Start") flows through our system using a `TimerEvent`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Actions as Actions Widget
    participant TimerEvent as TimerEvent (Command)
    participant TimerBloc as TimerBloc (Brain)
    participant TimerState as TimerState (New Condition)
    participant TimerText as TimerText Widget

    User->Actions: Taps "Start" Button
    Actions->TimerEvent: Creates TimerStarted Event
    Actions->TimerBloc: Adds TimerStarted Event
    TimerBloc->TimerBloc: Processes TimerStarted Event (e.g., starts counting)
    TimerBloc->TimerState: Creates New TimerState (e.g., TimerRunInProgress)
    TimerBloc-->TimerBloc: Emits New TimerState
    TimerBloc-->Actions: Notifies of New State (Actions may rebuild)
    TimerBloc-->TimerText: Notifies of New State (TimerText rebuilds if duration changed)
    TimerText-->User: Shows updated time ("02:59")
```

In this flow:

1.  You tap a button in the `Actions` widget.
2.  The `Actions` widget creates the correct `TimerEvent` (the command).
3.  The `Actions` widget sends (adds) this event to the `TimerBloc`.
4.  The `TimerBloc` receives and processes the event according to its rules (the `on` handlers).
5.  Based on the event, the `TimerBloc` decides what the new condition of the timer should be and creates a new `TimerState`.
6.  The `TimerBloc` broadcasts ("emits") this new `TimerState`.
7.  Widgets like `Actions` and `TimerText` are listening to the `TimerBloc`. When they hear about a new state, they update themselves accordingly (e.g., `Actions` shows different buttons, `TimerText` shows the new duration).

### Conclusion

`TimerEvent`s are the way our user interface (specifically the `Actions` widget) communicates with the core logic "brain," the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md). They represent the *intent* of the user â€“ what they want the timer to *do*. By sending these clear, structured commands, we keep the UI simple (it just sends messages) and the logic centralized in the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md), which knows how to act upon these commands.

We now understand how the UI sends commands. Next, we'll dive deep into the [TimerBloc](05_timerbloc_.md) itself to see how it receives these events and uses them to manage the timer's duration and state.
