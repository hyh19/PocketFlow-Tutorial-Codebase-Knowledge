# Chapter 5: TimerBloc

Alright, welcome back! In our previous chapters, we built the look and feel of our timer: the main screen ([Chapter 1: TimerPage/TimerView](01_timerpage_timerview_.md)), the buttons ([Chapter 2: Actions (Widget)](02_actions__widget_.md)), and the time display ([Chapter 3: TimerText (Widget)](03_timertext__widget_.md)). We also learned about [TimerEvent](04_timerevent_.md)s ([Chapter 4: TimerEvent](04_timerevent_.md)), which are the "commands" our buttons send to the timer.

Now, it's time to meet the **brain** of our timer app: the `TimerBloc`. This is where all the important decisions are made and where the timer actually counts down.

### What is the TimerBloc? The Brain of the Timer

Imagine the `TimerBloc` is the central control room for our timer. It holds all the important information:

*   How much time is currently left?
*   Is the timer running, paused, or finished?

And it knows how to react to the commands ([TimerEvent](04_timerevent_.md)s) sent its way:

*   When it gets a "Start" command, it starts counting down.
*   When it gets a "Pause" command, it stops counting.
*   When it gets a "Reset" command, it sets the time back to the beginning.
*   When it gets a "_TimerTicked" event (its internal reminder), it subtracts one second from the time.

The `TimerBloc` works with a special helper called a [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) to actually count the seconds. We'll learn more about the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) in a later chapter, but for now, think of it as the stopwatch that the `TimerBloc` tells to start and stop.

The `TimerBloc` is built using a powerful pattern called **Bloc** (Business Logic Component), which helps separate the user interface (what you see) from the business logic (how things work).

### TimerBloc's Main Responsibilities

The `TimerBloc` has two main jobs:

1.  **Manage the State:** It keeps track of the timer's current condition ([TimerState](06_timerstate_.md)). Is it just starting (`TimerInitial`)? Is it counting down (`TimerRunInProgress`)? Is it paused (`TimerRunPause`)? Has it finished (`TimerRunComplete`)? It holds the current `duration` (time left) as part of this state.
2.  **Process Events:** It listens for [TimerEvent](04_timerevent_.md)s (the commands from the UI or from itself) and updates the state accordingly.

### How TimerBloc Works: Receiving Events and Emitting States

Here's the basic cycle of the `TimerBloc`:

1.  The `TimerBloc` starts with an initial state, usually `TimerInitial` with a default duration (like 60 seconds).
2.  It waits for an event.
3.  Something happens that sends an event (like the user tapping a button, or the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) "ticking").
4.  The `TimerBloc` receives the event.
5.  Based on the type of event and its current state, the `TimerBloc` decides what the new state should be.
6.  The `TimerBloc` *emits* (sends out) this new state.
7.  Widgets that are listening to the `TimerBloc` (like `TimerText` and `Actions`) receive the new state and update themselves to show the latest information.
8.  Go back to step 2 and wait for the next event.

Let's look at the core structure of the `TimerBloc` code:

```dart
// Inside lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart

class TimerBloc extends Bloc<TimerEvent, TimerState> {
  // Constructor: this is where the bloc is created
  TimerBloc({required Ticker ticker})
      : _ticker = ticker,
        super(const TimerInitial(_duration)) { // Start with the initial state
    // These are the handlers for each event type
    on<TimerStarted>(_onStarted);
    on<TimerPaused>(_onPaused);
    on<TimerResumed>(_onResumed);
    on<TimerReset>(_onReset);
    on<_TimerTicked>(_onTicked);
  }

  final Ticker _ticker; // Holds a reference to the Ticker helper
  static const int _duration = 60; // The initial timer duration

  StreamSubscription<int>? _tickerSubscription; // Manages the ticking

  @override
  Future<void> close() {
    // Clean up the ticker when the bloc is closed
    _tickerSubscription?.cancel();
    return super.close();
  }

  // Methods that handle specific events (explained below)
  void _onStarted(TimerStarted event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) { ... }
  void _onPaused(TimerPaused event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) { ... }
  void _onResumed(TimerResumed event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) { ... }
  void _onReset(TimerReset event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) { ... }
  void _onTicked(_TimerTicked event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) { ... }
}
```

In this code:

*   `class TimerBloc extends Bloc<TimerEvent, TimerState>`: This declares our `TimerBloc`. It inherits powerful features from the `Bloc` class. The `<TimerEvent, TimerState>` tells the Bloc that it will receive `TimerEvent`s and manage `TimerState`s.
*   `super(const TimerInitial(_duration))`: When the `TimerBloc` is created, this line tells it to start with the `TimerInitial` state, setting the initial duration to `_duration` (60 seconds).
*   `on<EventType>(_onMethod)`: These lines are the event handlers. They connect each `TimerEvent` type (like `TimerStarted`) to a specific method (`_onStarted`) that contains the logic for handling that event. The `Emitter<TimerState> emit` parameter in the handler methods is crucial â€“ it's used to **emit** new states.
*   `_ticker`: This stores the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) object, which helps us count down the seconds.
*   `_tickerSubscription`: When the timer is running, the `Ticker` sends out a signal every second. This subscription is like the connection cable that receives those signals. We need to manage it to start and stop the ticking.
*   `close()`: This method is called when the `TimerBloc` is no longer needed (like when the screen is closed). It's important to clean up the `_tickerSubscription` to prevent memory leaks.

### Handling Specific Events (The Logic)

Now let's briefly look at what happens inside the event handler methods (the `_on...` functions). Remember, their job is to take an event and emit a new state. The `emit` function is how the bloc tells the world its state has changed.

#### 1. Handling `TimerStarted` (`_onStarted`)

When the `TimerBloc` receives a `TimerStarted` event:

```dart
// Inside TimerBloc (lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart)
void _onStarted(TimerStarted event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) {
  emit(TimerRunInProgress(event.duration)); // 1. Change state to Running
  _tickerSubscription?.cancel();           // 2. Stop any previous ticking
  _tickerSubscription = _ticker           // 3. Start a new ticker subscription
      .tick(ticks: event.duration)
      .listen((duration) => add(_TimerTicked(duration: duration))); // 4. For each tick, add a _TimerTicked event
}
```

1.  `emit(TimerRunInProgress(event.duration))`: It immediately changes the state to `TimerRunInProgress`, setting the current duration to the one provided by the `TimerStarted` event.
2.  `_tickerSubscription?.cancel()`: It stops any existing tick timer (in case you hit Start twice).
3.  `_ticker.tick(ticks: event.duration)`: It tells the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) to start ticking down from the specified `duration`.
4.  `.listen(...) => add(_TimerTicked(duration: duration))`: This is important! For every "tick" the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) sends, the `TimerBloc` receives the updated `duration` and internally sends (adds) a `_TimerTicked` event to *itself*.

#### 2. Handling `_TimerTicked` (`_onTicked`)

This is the event that makes the timer count down. It's sent by the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) (via the subscription).

```dart
// Inside TimerBloc (lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart)
void _onTicked(_TimerTicked event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) {
  emit(
    event.duration > 0
        ? TimerRunInProgress(event.duration) // 1. If time left, stay Running
        : const TimerRunComplete(),        // 2. If time is 0, change to Complete
  );
}
```

1.  `event.duration > 0 ? TimerRunInProgress(event.duration)`: If the new duration received from the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) is greater than 0, the state is updated to `TimerRunInProgress` with the new duration. This causes the `TimerText` widget to update.
2.  `: const TimerRunComplete()`: If the duration reaches 0, the state is changed to `TimerRunComplete`.

#### 3. Handling `TimerPaused` (`_onPaused`)

```dart
// Inside TimerBloc (lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart)
void _onPaused(TimerPaused event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) {
  if (state is TimerRunInProgress) { // 1. Only pause if it's currently running
    _tickerSubscription?.pause();   // 2. Tell the ticker to pause
    emit(TimerRunPause(state.duration)); // 3. Change state to Paused
  }
}
```

1.  It first checks if the current state is `TimerRunInProgress`. You can only pause a running timer!
2.  `_tickerSubscription?.pause()`: It tells the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) to pause its counting.
3.  `emit(TimerRunPause(state.duration))`: It changes the state to `TimerRunPause`, remembering the duration at which it was paused.

#### 4. Handling `TimerResumed` (`_onResumed`)

```dart
// Inside TimerBloc (lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart)
void _onResumed(TimerResumed resume, Emitter<TimerState> emit) {
  if (state is TimerRunPause) { // 1. Only resume if it's currently paused
    _tickerSubscription?.resume(); // 2. Tell the ticker to resume
    emit(TimerRunInProgress(state.duration)); // 3. Change state back to Running
  }
}
```

1.  It checks if the current state is `TimerRunPause`. You can only resume a paused timer!
2.  `_tickerSubscription?.resume()`: It tells the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) to continue counting.
3.  `emit(TimerRunInProgress(state.duration))`: It changes the state back to `TimerRunInProgress`.

#### 5. Handling `TimerReset` (`_onReset`)

```dart
// Inside TimerBloc (lib/timer/bloc/timer_bloc.dart)
void _onReset(TimerReset event, Emitter<TimerState> emit) {
  _tickerSubscription?.cancel(); // 1. Stop the ticker completely
  emit(const TimerInitial(_duration)); // 2. Change state back to initial
}
```

1.  `_tickerSubscription?.cancel()`: This stops the [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) from counting, no matter what it was doing (running or paused).
2.  `emit(const TimerInitial(_duration))`: It sets the state back to `TimerInitial` with the original duration.

### The Flow: Events In, States Out

Here's a diagram showing how the `TimerBloc` acts as the central hub, receiving events and emitting states that affect the UI:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as UI Widgets (Actions, TimerText)
    participant TimerEvent as TimerEvent (Command)
    participant TimerBloc as TimerBloc (Brain)
    participant TimerState as TimerState (New Condition)
    participant Ticker as Ticker (Counts Seconds)

    UI->TimerEvent: User Action (e.g., Tap Start) creates Event
    TimerEvent->TimerBloc: Event is added to the Bloc
    TimerBloc->TimerBloc: Bloc processes Event based on its type (on methods)
    opt TimerStarted / TimerResumed
        TimerBloc->Ticker: Tell Ticker to start/resume
        loop Every Second (while running)
            Ticker-->TimerBloc: Send _TimerTicked Event to Bloc
            TimerBloc->TimerBloc: Bloc processes _TimerTicked Event
            TimerBloc->TimerState: Creates new TimerState (updated duration)
            TimerBloc-->TimerBloc: Emits new TimerState
        end
    end
    opt TimerPaused
        TimerBloc->Ticker: Tell Ticker to pause
        TimerBloc->TimerState: Creates new TimerState (Pause)
        TimerBloc-->TimerBloc: Emits new TimerState
    end
        opt TimerReset
        TimerBloc->Ticker: Tell Ticker to cancel
        TimerBloc->TimerState: Creates new TimerState (Initial)
        TimerBloc-->TimerBloc: Emits new TimerState
    end

    TimerBloc-->UI: New TimerState is received by listeners (BlocBuilder, select)
    UI->UI: UI updates its display (buttons, time text) based on the new state
```

This diagram shows that the `TimerBloc` sits in the middle, reacting to events and producing states. The [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) is a dependency that helps the `TimerBloc` execute the "start" and "tick" logic.

### Conclusion

The `TimerBloc` is the core logic handler for our timer application. It receives `TimerEvent` commands, uses a [Ticker](07_ticker_.md) to manage the countdown, and updates its internal `TimerState` which it then emits for the UI to react to. By separating this logic into the `TimerBloc`, our UI widgets remain simple and focused on just displaying information and sending events. This makes our app organized and easier to manage.

We've seen how the `TimerBloc` *manages* the state by changing it. In the next chapter, we'll take a closer look at what the `TimerState` itself is and the different conditions it can represent.
