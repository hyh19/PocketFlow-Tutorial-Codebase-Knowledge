# Chapter 2: Listenable

In the first chapter, we learned about [ChangeNotifier](01_changenotifier_.md), a powerful helper for letting other parts of your app know when something changes. `ChangeNotifier` is great because it manages who wants to listen and calls them when you say `notifyListeners()`.

Now, let's talk about a more fundamental concept that `ChangeNotifier` builds upon: the `Listenable`.

### What is a Listenable?

Imagine you have a broadcasting system. `ChangeNotifier` is like the specific radio station that plays music and tells everyone when a new song starts. The `Listenable` is like the *idea* of a broadcasting system itself. It's the fundamental capability to "be listened to".

A `Listenable` is an object that simply has the ability to:

1.  Allow someone to **start listening** for changes.
2.  Allow someone to **stop listening** for changes.

That's it! It doesn't care *what* changed, or *how* it changed, or even hold any data itself. It's just the blueprint for an object that can be observed by others.

### Why do we need Listenable?

Think back to our counter example from Chapter 1. Our `MyCounter` class used `ChangeNotifier` to announce when the count changed.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

class MyCounter with ChangeNotifier { // MyCounter is a Listenable!
  int _count = 0;

  int get count => _count;

  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners(); // Announces the change
  }
}
```

Here, `MyCounter` is not just a `ChangeNotifier`; it *is* also a `Listenable`. Because `ChangeNotifier` *implements* the `Listenable` interface, anything that works with a `ChangeNotifier` can also work with any other object that implements `Listenable`.

This is super useful because it allows different types of objects to participate in the same "notification system." For example, Flutter has other objects that implement `Listenable`, like `Animation` objects which notify listeners when animation values change. Widgets in Flutter that need to react to changes (like `AnimatedBuilder` which we'll see later) can work with *any* `Listenable`, whether it's a `ChangeNotifier`, an `Animation`, or something else!

It makes our code more flexible and reusable.

### How does Listenable work?

The `Listenable` itself is an abstract class (or an interface in some programming terms). This means you can't create a `Listenable` object directly (`new Listenable()` doesn't work). Instead, other classes *implement* or *extend* `Listenable` to gain its "listenable" abilities.

The `Listenable` interface defines the two core methods we mentioned:

```dart
abstract class Listenable {
  // ... other factory methods ...

  /// Register a closure to be called when the object notifies its listeners.
  void addListener(VoidCallback listener);

  /// Remove a previously registered closure from the list of closures that the
  /// object notifies.
  void removeListener(VoidCallback listener);
}
```

*   `addListener`: This is how you tell the `Listenable` "Hey, when you change, run this function for me!". The `listener` is a `VoidCallback`, which is just a fancy name for a function that takes no arguments and returns nothing.
*   `removeListener`: This is how you tell the `Listenable` "Okay, I don't need to be notified anymore. Please stop calling my function."

Remember how `ChangeNotifier` had `addListener` and `removeListener`? That's because `ChangeNotifier` implements the `Listenable` interface! It provides the *actual* code behind those methods to manage the list of listeners.

### Adding and Removing Listeners (Manual Example)

While you'll typically use Flutter widgets to handle adding and removing listeners on `Listenable`s, understanding how it works manually helps solidify the concept.

Let's imagine our `MyCounter` object from Chapter 1 (which is a `Listenable` because it uses `ChangeNotifier`).

```dart
// Assume MyCounter class from Chapter 1 is defined

void main() {
  final counter = MyCounter(); // Our Listenable object

  // Define a listener function
  void counterChangedListener() {
    print('Counter changed! New value: ${counter.count}');
  }

  // Add the listener
  print('Adding listener...');
  counter.addListener(counterChangedListener);

  // Simulate a change (calling increment)
  print('Incrementing counter...');
  counter.increment(); // This will trigger notifyListeners(), which calls our listener!

  // Simulate another change
  print('Incrementing counter again...');
  counter.increment(); // The listener is called again!

  // Remove the listener
  print('Removing listener...');
  counter.removeListener(counterChangedListener);

  // Simulate a change again
  print('Incrementing counter one last time...');
  counter.increment(); // The listener is NOT called this time

  print('Done!');
}
```

If you run this code, you would see output like:

```
Adding listener...
Incrementing counter...
Counter changed! New value: 1
Incrementing counter again...
Counter changed! New value: 2
Removing listener...
Incrementing counter one last time...
Done!
```

See how the `counterChangedListener` function is called when `increment()` is called (because `increment()` calls `notifyListeners()`), but only *after* we've added the listener and *before* we've removed it?

This manual process demonstrates the core "listenable" behavior promised by the `Listenable` interface: you can add and remove notification callbacks.

### Listenable.merge

The `Listenable` interface also provides a handy factory constructor called `Listenable.merge`. This allows you to combine multiple `Listenable` objects into a single new `Listenable`. This new merged `Listenable` will notify its listeners whenever *any* of the original `Listenable`s notify *their* listeners.

```dart
// Imagine you have two Listenables (like two ChangeNotifiers)
final listenableA = MyCounter(); // Let's reuse MyCounter
final listenableB = MyCounter(); // Another counter

// Merge them into one Listenable
final mergedListenable = Listenable.merge([listenableA, listenableB]);

// Now you can add a single listener to the merged listenable
mergedListenable.addListener(() {
  print('Either Listenable A or Listenable B changed!');
});

// If listenableA changes, the merged listener is called:
listenableA.increment();

// If listenableB changes, the merged listener is also called:
listenableB.increment();

// If both change (unlikely in simple examples, but possible),
// the merged listener might be called multiple times depending on
// how the underlying Listenables notify.
```

This is useful when a widget needs to react to changes from several different sources.

### Listenable Interface (Code Deep Drive)

Looking at the actual Flutter code file for `change_notifier.dart`, you'll see the `Listenable` class defined:

```dart
abstract class Listenable {
  // Abstract const constructor. This constructor enables subclasses to provide
  // const constructors so that they can be used in const expressions.
  const Listenable();

  // Return a [Listenable] that triggers when any of the given [Listenable]s
  // themselves trigger.
  factory Listenable.merge(Iterable<Listenable?> listenables) = _MergingListenable;

  /// Register a closure to be called when the object notifies its listeners.
  void addListener(VoidCallback listener);

  /// Remove a previously registered closure from the list of closures that the
  /// object notifies.
  void removeListener(VoidCallback listener);
}
```

As we saw, it's an `abstract` class, meaning you can't create direct instances. It defines the `addListener` and `removeListener` methods that any class implementing `Listenable` *must* provide code for. The `factory Listenable.merge` is a special constructor that creates and returns a specific type of `Listenable` (`_MergingListenable`) when you call `Listenable.merge(...)`.

The `_MergingListenable` class (part of the same code) is a concrete implementation of `Listenable` that handles calling the `addListener` and `removeListener` on all the children it was given:

```dart
class _MergingListenable extends Listenable {
  _MergingListenable(this._children);

  final Iterable<Listenable?> _children;

  @override
  void addListener(VoidCallback listener) {
    for (final Listenable? child in _children) {
      child?.addListener(listener); // Calls addListener on each child!
    }
  }

  @override
  void removeListener(VoidCallback listener) {
    for (final Listenable? child in _children) {
      child?.removeListener(listener); // Calls removeListener on each child!
    }
  }
  // ... other code ...
}
```

This simple implementation shows that the `_MergingListenable` doesn't do much on its own; it just forwards the `addListener` and `removeListener` calls to the list of `Listenable`s it's wrapping. When any of those wrapped `Listenable`s notify their listeners, the listener you added to the `mergedListenable` will be among the functions called.

### Analogy Recap

*   **The Change:** The specific event that happens (e.g., the counter value goes from 1 to 2).
*   **The Listenable:** The object that *can* be watched for changes. It has the capability to manage a list of people who care (`addListener`, `removeListener`). It's the blueprint.
*   **The Listener (VoidCallback):** The function you provide that should be run when a change happens. It's the person who cares.
*   **ChangeNotifier:** A specific implementation of `Listenable` that provides the actual mechanics of storing listeners and notifying them when *you* tell it to using `notifyListeners()`. It's the radio station using the broadcasting blueprint.
*   **notifyListeners():** The action of telling the `Listenable` (or `ChangeNotifier`) to go through its list and call every listener function. It's the radio station announcing the new song.

### Conclusion

In summary, the `Listenable` interface defines the core contract for objects that can be observed for changes. It's a simple but powerful concept that allows different types of objects to participate in shared notification mechanisms. `ChangeNotifier`, which we discussed in the previous chapter, is one prominent implementation of `Listenable`.

Understanding `Listenable` helps us appreciate the flexibility in Flutter's architecture, where many widgets and systems are designed to work with any object that provides this basic listening capability.

In the next chapter, we'll look at another important concept: [ValueNotifier](03_valuenotifier_.md), which builds on `ChangeNotifier` and introduces the idea of a changing *value*.
