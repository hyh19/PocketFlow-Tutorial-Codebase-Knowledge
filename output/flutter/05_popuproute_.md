# Chapter 5: PopupRoute

Welcome back! In [Chapter 4: ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md), we learned about `ModalRoute`, a powerful tool for creating screens or overlays that block interaction with the content below, often with a dimming "modal barrier." This is perfect for full-screen pages and dialogs that demand the user's full attention.

But sometimes, you need something lighter â€“ a small menu that pops up, an informational bubble, or a simple toast message. These aren't full-screen pages and they don't always need a heavy modal barrier. They're more like small pieces of content that temporarily appear *on top* of the current screen. That's where `PopupRoute` comes in!

### What is a PopupRoute?

Think of our playing cards again, representing your screens ([Route](01_route_.md)s). A `PopupRoute` is like a very specific kind of transparent card you put on top, but it only contains a *small* image or text snippet, centered or placed in a specific spot. It doesn't usually cover the whole card below, and while it's technically a type of [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md) (meaning it can have a barrier), that barrier is often transparent or very light, and it might not block gestures to the same extent as a full modal.

The key idea is that a `PopupRoute` is designed for temporary, often non-fullscreen, overlay content.

Use cases for things that often use `PopupRoute` (or routes built on top of it) include:

*   **Dropdown menus:** When you tap a button and a small list of options appears below it.
*   **Tooltips:** The small informational boxes that appear when you long-press a UI element.
*   **Simple Popover notifications:** Small messages that appear briefly.

### Why Use PopupRoute?

`PopupRoute` is a specialized type of [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md) that comes with some default behaviors suitable for pop-up style elements. By inheriting from [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md), it automatically gets the ability to be displayed in the [Navigator](03_overlayroute_.md)'s [Overlay](03_overlayroute_.md) ([OverlayRoute](03_overlayroute_.md)) and handle entrance/exit animations ([TransitionRoute](02_transitionroute_.md)).

However, `PopupRoute` overrides some of the default `ModalRoute` properties to make it better suited for pop-ups:

*   **`opaque` is `false`:** By default, pop-ups are not fully opaque. You can usually see through them to the content below, or they only cover a small area. This is different from a full-screen page route where `opaque` is usually true.
*   **`maintainState` is `true`:** Pop-ups often appear and disappear quickly. Keeping the state of the route below them active can make transitions smoother.
*   **`allowSnapshotting` is `false`:** Pop-up animations are typically lightweight coordinate system transitions, rather than full-screen snapshots.

You won't usually create a raw `PopupRoute` yourself. You'll typically use concrete subclasses provided by the framework or packages, or build your own custom routes that extend `PopupRoute` for specialized pop-up needs. For example, the internal routes used for `showMenu` often extend `PopupRoute`.

### Key Concepts of PopupRoute

Since `PopupRoute` extends [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md), it inherits most of its concepts like the barrier (though often transparent), dismissibility, animation, and overlay management. The main distinctions are the default values for the properties mentioned above:

*   `opaque`: Defaults to `false` (not fully covering the previous route).
*   `maintainState`: Defaults to `true` (previous route state is maintained).
*   `allowSnapshotting`: Defaults to `false` (doesn't use snapshots for transitions).
*   **Content Placement:** While the base `PopupRoute` doesn't dictate *where* on the screen the pop-up appears, concrete subclasses will handle positioning (e.g., relative to a button for a dropdown).
*   **Minimal Barrier:** Often configured with a fully transparent or nearly transparent barrier or no barrier at all, as interaction blocking might not be the primary goal.

### How PopupRoute Works (Conceptually simplified)

Let's imagine a simple pop-up message. When a `PopupRoute` for this message is pushed:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant App as App
    participant Navigator as Navigator
    participant CurrentRoute as Current Route
    participant PopupRoute as Popup Route
    participant BarrierEntry as Barrier Overlay Entry
    participant PopupContentEntry as Popup Content Overlay Entry
    participant Overlay as Overlay

    User->>App: Tap button (e.g., show message)
    App->>Navigator: Push Popup Route (Message Route)
    Navigator->>PopupRoute: Create Popup Route
    PopupRoute->>BarrierEntry: Create Barrier Overlay Entry (potentially transparent)
    PopupRoute->>PopupContentEntry: Create Popup Content Overlay Entry (Message content)
    BarrierEntry->>Navigator: Add Barrier Entry to Overlay
    PopupContentEntry->>Navigator: Add Popup Content Entry to Overlay
    Navigator->>Overlay: Draw Potentially Invisible Barrier and Message on top
    Navigator->>PopupRoute: Start Entry Transition (calls buildTransitions)
    PopupRoute-->>App: Message animates into view (fades/slides)

```

Similar to a regular [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md), it creates `OverlayEntry`s for a barrier (even if transparent) and its content, adding them to the [Navigator](03_overlayroute_.md)'s `Overlay`. The difference is in how these entries are built and behave based on the `PopupRoute`'s default properties and the specific implementation of the pop-up itself (e.g., its size, position, and custom transitions).

When the `PopupRoute` is popped (the message disappears or is tapped):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant App as App
    participant Navigator as Navigator
    participant PopupRoute as Popup Route
    participant BarrierEntry as Barrier Overlay Entry
    participant PopupContentEntry as Popup Content Overlay Entry
    participant Overlay as Overlay

    User->>App: Tap away / Timer expires / Tap message
    App->>Navigator: Pop Popup Route
    Navigator->>PopupRoute: Start Exit Transition
    PopupRoute-->>App: Message animates out of view (fades/slides out)
    Navigator->>BarrierEntry: Dispose Barrier Entry (after animation)
    Navigator->>PopupContentEntry: Dispose Popup Content Entry (after animation)
    Overlay->>Navigator: Remove Barrier and Content
    Navigator->>PopupRoute: Dispose Popup Route (after animation and removal)

```

The animation runs in reverse, and the `OverlayEntry`s are removed.

### Looking at the Code

Let's look at the simple definition of the `PopupRoute` class from the provided snippet.

```dart
abstract class PopupRoute<T> extends ModalRoute<T> {
  /// Initializes the [PopupRoute].
  PopupRoute({super.settings, super.requestFocus, super.filter, super.traversalEdgeBehavior});

  @override
  bool get opaque => false;

  @override
  bool get maintainState => true;

  @override
  bool get allowSnapshotting => false;
}
```

As you can see:

*   `abstract class PopupRoute<T> extends ModalRoute<T>`: It directly inherits from [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md).
*   It overrides three properties: `opaque`, `maintainState`, and `allowSnapshotting` to provide the default behaviors expected for pop-up style routes. These defaults are specifically chosen because pop-ups typically appear as overlays without fully obscuring the previous route (`opaque: false`), often need the previous route's state intact for smooth transitions (`maintainState: true`), and rely on widget-based position/size animations rather than rendering snapshots (`allowSnapshotting: false`).

These simple overrides make `PopupRoute` a convenient starting point for creating new types of pop-up overlays.

### Example: A Simple Pop-up with RawDialogRoute

While directly extending `PopupRoute` is less common for beginners, `RawDialogRoute` (which `showGeneralDialog` uses internally) *is* a `PopupRoute`. Let's revisit a slightly modified conceptual example using `RawDialogRoute` to see how it aligns with `PopupRoute` characteristics.

`RawDialogRoute` inherently embodies the `PopupRoute` concept because it's designed for showing arbitrary content ([`pageBuilder`](#pageBuilder)) often not full-screen, typically with a barrier (configurable color/dismissibility), and benefiting from the default non-opaque behavior.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Using showGeneralDialog which creates a RawDialogRoute internally
Future<void> showSimplePopup(BuildContext context, String message) async {
  await showGeneralDialog<void>(
    context: context,
    barrierColor: Colors.black.withOpacity(0.1), // A very light semi-transparent barrier
    barrierDismissible: true, // Tap outside to dismiss
    barrierLabel: 'Dismiss Message',
    transitionDuration: const Duration(milliseconds: 200),
    // RawDialogRoute sets this to PopupRoute which defaults to false
    // allowSnapshotting: false, // This is already the default for PopupRoute

    pageBuilder: (
      BuildContext dialogContext,
      Animation<double> animation,
      Animation<double> secondaryAnimation,
    ) {
      // This is where you build the content of your pop-up
      return Center( // Center the popup content
        child: Card( // Put content in a card
          margin: const EdgeInsets.all(50.0),
          child: Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
            child: Text(message), // Show the message
          ),
        ),
      );
    },
     transitionBuilder: (
      BuildContext context,
      Animation<double> animation,
      Animation<double> secondaryAnimation,
      Widget child,
    ) {
      // Define how the popup animates in/out
      return ScaleTransition( // Scale animation
        scale: CurvedAnimation( // Use a curve for smoother animation
          parent: animation,
          curve: Curves.easeOutCubic,
        ),
        child: child, // The content from pageBuilder
      );
    },
  );
}

// Example usage in a widget:
// ElevatedButton(
//   onPressed: () {
//     showSimplePopup(context, 'Hello from the popup!');
//   },
//   child: const Text('Show Popup'),
// )

```

In this example, calling `showSimplePopup` uses `showGeneralDialog`, which creates a `RawDialogRoute` (a `PopupRoute`). We configure a very light barrier, make it dismissible by tapping the barrier, and provide a `pageBuilder` to define the content (a centered `Card` with text) and a `transitionBuilder` for a scale animation.

Because `RawDialogRoute` is a `PopupRoute`, it benefits from the `opaque: false` default, allowing you to see the content behind the pop-up. The `maintainState: true` default helps ensure smooth transitions.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we introduced `PopupRoute`, a specialized type of [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md) tailored for creating temporary, often non-fullscreen, overlay elements like menus and simple notifications. We learned how it inherits capabilities from [ModalRoute](04_modalroute_.md) and [TransitionRoute](02_transitionroute_.md) but overrides properties like `opaque`, `maintainState`, and `allowSnapshotting` to better fit typical pop-up behaviors. While you often use routes like `RawDialogRoute` (created by `showGeneralDialog`) that are subclasses of `PopupRoute`, understanding `PopupRoute` helps explain why these elements behave the way they do.

In the next chapter, we'll briefly look at [PredictiveBackRoute](06_predictivebackroute_.md), an interface related to handling platform-specific back gestures.
